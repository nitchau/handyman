    description: "This design transforms a dated 1990s bathroom into a modern farmhouse retreat. The key moves: replacing the vanity with a floating oak piece, switching from small ceramic floor tiles to large-format marble hex, and adding matte black fixtures throughout.\n\nThe total material cost came in under $2,800 \u2014 which is remarkable for a bathroom that looks like it cost $10K+. The secret is strategic splurging: the marble hex tile IS real marble but at a builder-grade price point from Lowe\u2019s.",
